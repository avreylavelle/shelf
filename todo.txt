Shelf Expansion Roadmap

Phase 1 — Stabilize the Manga Core
- Polish UX: consistent nav, friendly errors, loading states
- Ratings flow: show current rating, edit inline, prevent duplicates
- History visibility: show what drives recs + allow reset
- Admin tools: user switch, rating import/export

Phase 2 — Expand Content Types
- Add Content Type filter: Manga | Book | Light Novel
- Normalize IDs for multiple datasets in one ratings table
- Per-type metadata (author, publisher, page count)

Phase 3 — Mixed Library
- Cross-type recommendations (manga -> novels, etc.)
- Normalize genres/themes across datasets
- Collections + reading status (reading, finished, dropped)

Phase 4 — Personalization & Discovery
- Onboarding: seed preferences from 5–10 items
- "Because you rated X" explanations
- Explore page: trending, top-rated, seasonal picks

Phase 5 — Social & Sharing (Optional)
- Shareable profile page
- Public lists
- Lightweight follows/likes
