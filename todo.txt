Shelf Expansion Roadmap (Updated)

Phase 1 — Core UX & Data Integrity (Now)
- UX polish baseline: consistent nav, toasts, loading states, hover states, layout fixes
- Ratings/Reading/DNR exclusivity rules enforced across all flows
- Sorting + filters with saved UI prefs for Ratings, DNR, Reading List
- Language-aware display + alphabetical sorting by displayed language
- Admin tools: user switch + CSV import/export
- Confirm: log + handle all remaining server errors and edge cases

Phase 1.5 — Recommendation Engine Improvements (Short-term)
- Add “Reroll” button: re-run recommendations without changing filters
- Randomization with guardrails: keep top N weighted, shuffle mid‑tier
- Diversity controls: genre/theme spread + avoid near‑duplicate series
- Freshness: optional “include less popular” toggle (novelty boost)
- Explainability: “Because you rated X / liked genre Y” badges per item

Phase 2 — Personalization & User Modeling
- Per-user preference model (explicit + implicit signals)
- Store user feedback signals: clicked, rated, DNR, reading list, finished
- Per-user weighting: tune match_score weights based on history
- Feature flags for A/B: baseline vs personalized weights
- Export per-user model snapshot (for debugging)

Phase 3 — ML Iteration (Opt-in)
- Lightweight per-user ML (e.g., logistic regression or matrix factorization)
- Model retrain schedule + caching
- Training dataset pipeline: ratings + implicit feedback
- Guardrails: cold-start fallback, minimum data threshold

Phase 4 — Content Expansion
- Add content types: Manga | Light Novel | Book
- Normalize IDs + metadata across datasets
- Cross-type recommendations (manga → novels, etc.)
- Per-type filters and UI tabs

Phase 5 — Discovery & Social (Optional)
- Explore page: trending, top-rated, seasonal picks
- Public lists + shareable profile page
- Optional follows/likes

Notes
- Randomization should never return already-rated or DNR items.
- “Reroll” uses same filters, just reshuffles eligible set.
- ML should remain optional and transparent; keep baseline recommender.
