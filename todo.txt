Shelf Expansion Roadmap (Updated)

Phase 1 — Core UX & Data Integrity (Done)
- UX polish baseline: consistent nav, toasts, loading states, hover states, layout fixes
- Ratings/Reading/DNR exclusivity rules enforced across all flows
- Sorting + filters with saved UI prefs for Ratings, DNR, Reading List
- Language-aware display + alphabetical sorting by displayed language
- Admin tools: user switch + CSV import/export
- Confirm: log + handle all remaining server errors and edge cases

Phase 1.5 — Recommendation Engine Improvements (Done)
- Reroll button + guardrails (anchors + weighted mid-tier shuffle)
- Diversity controls: genre/theme spread + avoid near-duplicate series
- Freshness toggle: include less popular (novelty boost)
- Explainability badges per item (requested/history/rated)
- Advanced options modal (recs)
- Earliest year preference (soft bias)

Phase 2 — Personalization & User Modeling (Done)
- Per-user preference model (explicit + implicit signals)
- Store user feedback signals: clicked, rated, DNR, reading list, finished
- Per-user weighting: tune match_score weights based on history
- Feature flags for A/B: baseline vs personalized weights
- Export per-user model snapshot (for debugging)
- Guardrails: cold-start fallback and capped influence
- Transparency: personalization toggle + strength ramping

Phase 3 — ML Iteration (Opt-in)
- Lightweight per-user ML (e.g., logistic regression or matrix factorization)
- Model retrain schedule + caching
- Training dataset pipeline: ratings + implicit feedback
- Guardrails: cold-start fallback, minimum data threshold

Phase 4 — Content Expansion (In progress)
- Content type filters in recommendations (Manga/Manhwa/Manhua/Novel/Light Novel/etc.)
- Add content types: Manga | Light Novel | Book
- Normalize IDs + metadata across datasets
- Cross-type recommendations (manga → novels, etc.)
- Per-type filters and UI tabs

Phase 5 — Discovery & Social (Optional)
- Explore page: trending, top-rated, seasonal picks
- Public lists + shareable profile page
- Optional follows/likes

Notes
- Randomization should never return already-rated or DNR items.
- “Reroll” uses same filters, just reshuffles eligible set.
- ML should remain optional and transparent; keep baseline recommender.

Reading list does not save sort type on exit, and content types are all off by default
